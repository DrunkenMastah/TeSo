*Hopefully* a somewhat functional command line interface

Requires installation of NodeJs
Requires import of "commander", "request", "fs" and "form-data" libraries
They are included in the package.json file
Just open cmd and use:

```
$ npm install 
```


TODO
1. Missing parsing of server response

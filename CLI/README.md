*Hopefully* a somewhat functioning command line interface

Requires installation of "commander" and "request" 
```
$ npm install commander
$ npm install request
```


TODO
1. Make proper function for http put requests
2. Implement --source param file upload
3. Missing parsing of server response
4. Make a proper --help command
